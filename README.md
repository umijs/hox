## Why Hox?

- Direct reuse of existing React knowledge, almost no learning cost, how you write React components, you can write Store
- Designed for flexible refactoring, using the same DSL in Store and components allows you to convert a component's local state into a state shared between components at almost zero cost
- Supports both local and global states, a good balance between flexibility and simplicity
- Excellent performance and TypeScript support
